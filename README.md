 ## Project Name : Book Here

## 🏨 Project Idea: Book Here

**Book Here** is a hotel booking website that allows users to easily explore available rooms, view hotel services, and make reservations online.
The system also provides a client page where each user can view their booking details, including room type, price, and available offers or services.

The main goal of the project is to create a simple and user-friendly hotel booking experience that helps users find and book rooms efficiently while giving the hotel an organized way to manage its bookings and services.

## Project Task Division

Our **Book Here** project is a simple web application with only front-end and back-end components.  
The work is divided among four team members as follows:-

### 1. Front-End Basics  — [Eman Gamal]
- Build the main pages using **HTML** (Home, Search, Booking).
- Add simple **CSS** for layout and basic styling.
- Ensure the site is responsive and works on mobile screens.

### 2. Front-End Logic  — [Mohamed Gamal]
- Implement interactive features using JavaScript (e.g., search filters, date inputs).
- Connect the front-end to the back-end APIs built with Node.js + Express.
- Validate user input on the client-side before sending it to the server.

### 3. Back-End & Database  — [Omar Mohammed]
- Create and manage the database using MongoDB with collections for hotels and bookings.
- Develop the server-side code with Node.js + Express to handle APIs for hotels and bookings.
- Implement features for fetching hotels, storing reservations, and managing booking data.
- Add basic security checks and input validation to protect the system.

### 4. Integration & Deployment  — [Ola Elwan]
- Merge front-end and back-end code and resolve conflicts.
- Deploy the final version to **GitHub Pages**.
- Prepare the final **README.md** and documentation.
