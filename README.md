## Project Task Division

Our **Book Here** project is a simple web application with only front-end and back-end components.  
The work is divided among four team members as follows:-

### 1. Front-End Basics  — [Eman Gamal]
- Build the main pages using **HTML** (Home, Search, Booking).
- Add simple **CSS** for layout and basic styling.
- Ensure the site is responsive and works on mobile screens.

### 2. Front-End Logic  — [Mohamed Gamal]
- Implement interactive features with **JavaScript** (e.g., search filters, date inputs).
- Connect the front-end to the back-end APIs or PHP/Node files.
- Validate user input before sending data to the server.

### 3. Back-End & Database  — [Omar Mohamed]
- Create the **database** (MySQL/SQLite) with tables for hotels and bookings.
- Develop the **server-side code** (PHP or Node.js) to fetch hotels and store bookings.
- Add basic security checks (e.g., form validation).

### 4. Integration & Deployment  — [Ola Elwan]
- Merge front-end and back-end code and resolve conflicts.
- Deploy the final version to **GitHub Pages**.
- Prepare the final **README.md** and documentation.

### Suggested Timeline
- **Days 1–2:** Set up the database and basic HTML structure.  
- **Day 3:** Connect front-end to back-end.  
- **Day 4:** Final testing and deployment.
