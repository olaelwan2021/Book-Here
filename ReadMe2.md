# Book-Here Frontend Project

## Project Idea: 

Book Here is a hotel booking website that allows users to easily explore available
rooms, view hotel services, and make reservations online.

The system also provides a client page where each user can view their booking
details, including room type, price, and available offers or services.

The main goal of the project is to create a simple and user-friendly hotel booking
experience that helps users find and book rooms efficiently while giving the hotel an
organized way to manage its bookings and services.
